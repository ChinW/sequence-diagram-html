# Sequence Diagrams for HTML

This is a set of stylesheets for displaying sequence diagrams in HTML pages.

You can preview it at the [demo page](http://geraintluff.github.io/sequence-diagram-html/example-css.html) - be sure to look at the source!

## Conversion from text

Also included is a (fairly hacky) convertor that takes in a simple text format and outputs HTML:

```
Alice --> Carol: say hello
Carol: (notes go here)
Dani: some event
```
