# Sequence Diagrams for HTML

This is a set of stylesheets for displaying sequence diagrams in HTML pages.

You can write your diagram as CSS ([demo page](http://geraintluff.github.io/sequence-diagram-html/example-css.html)) or semantic markup ([demo page](http://geraintluff.github.io/sequence-diagram-html/example-semantic.html)).  Look at the source for each one to see how it works!

## Conversion from text

Also included is a (fairly hacky) convertor that takes in a simple text format and outputs HTML:

```
Alice --> Carol: say hello
Carol: (notes go here)
Dani: some event
```

See more at the [live demo](http://geraintluff.github.io/sequence-diagram-html/).
